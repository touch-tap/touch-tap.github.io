  <h1>AppBox: Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> May 16, 2025</p>
  <p>We respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how AppBox handles data when you use the app.</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>AppBox does <strong>not collect</strong> any personally identifiable information. All data handled by the app consists of publicly available metadata from the Apple App Store, which the user explicitly imports.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Storage and Sync</h2>
  <p>Imported data is stored locally on your device and optionally synced to your iCloud account using Apple’s CloudKit. This data never leaves the Apple ecosystem and is not accessible to us or any third party.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Export</h2>
  <p>Users can export their data at any time in CSV or JSON format. The exported data includes only app metadata and organizational information added within the app. No personal or identifying data is included in these exports.</p>

  <h2>4. Advertising</h2>
  <p>AppBox integrates <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to serve <strong>non-personalised ads</strong>. These are optional and only shown when a user chooses to watch an ad to temporarily unlock premium features.</p>
  <p>AdMob may use device-level identifiers to limit ad frequency or detect fraud, but no data is linked to your identity. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a> for more information.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>AppBox uses the following third-party services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Apple CloudKit</strong>: To sync app data securely across your devices via iCloud.</li>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong>: To serve optional non-personalised ads for temporary premium access.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>AppBox does not target children and does not knowingly collect any personal information from users of any age.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy as the app evolves. Any changes will be posted here and reflected in the date above.</p>
