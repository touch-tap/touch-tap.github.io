  <h1>FloatTab: Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 2, 2025</p>
  <p>We take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how FloatTab handles data when you use the app.</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>FloatTab does <strong>not collect</strong> any personally identifiable information. The app runs entirely on your device and does not transmit or store user content externally.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Storage and Sync</h2>
  <p>Your usage history and floating content are stored locally on your device and optionally synced to your iCloud account using Apple’s CloudKit. This data remains within Apple’s ecosystem and is not accessible to us or any third parties.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Export</h2>
  <p>FloatTab does not support exporting data at this time. All content is user-generated and remains securely on your device or in iCloud, depending on your settings.</p>

  <h2>4. Advertising</h2>
  <p>FloatTab uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display <strong>non-personalised ads</strong> when you choose to unlock premium features by watching an ad. These ads are optional.</p>
  <p>AdMob may use device-level identifiers for fraud prevention and ad frequency capping. No data is linked to your identity. For more information, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>FloatTab integrates the following services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Apple CloudKit</strong>: For syncing your floating content and history across your devices via iCloud.</li>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong>: For displaying optional non-personalised ads to unlock premium features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>FloatTab is not directed at children and does not knowingly collect personal information from users of any age.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>This policy may be updated as the app evolves. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date above.</p>
